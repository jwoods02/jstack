# JStack

<img src="./assets/logo.svg" alt="JStack logo" width="96" />

JStack is James Woods's personal adaptation of [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack), the agent-workflow plugin by Lauren Tan ([poteto](https://x.com/poteto)). it is Cursor-only. the skills and principles come from pstack. the workflow in `j-mode` is James's own.

## install

in cursor, open customize, choose from github repository, and add `jwoods02/jstack`. install the `jstack` plugin. models are already chosen in [`rules/jstack-models.mdc`](./rules/jstack-models.mdc), so there is nothing to set up. the [guide](./docs/guide.md) is one short page.

## how it works

type [`/j-mode`](./skills/j-mode/SKILL.md) with a goal and a way to check it's done. it picks one job:

| job | when | model |
|---|---|---|
| coordinator | the Project chat. picks jobs, starts builders and reviewers, briefs James | opus 5.5 high |
| architect | before a big change, or when the design is unclear. ends with a short decision list | opus 5.5 high; extra high for load-bearing designs |
| plan reviewer | plans of three or more PRs, before any builder starts | opus 5.5 high; extra high for load-bearing plans |
| builder | one per PR. draft PR, CI green, then "ready for review" | opus 5.5 medium by default; opus 5.5 high for a very complex change; sonnet 5.5 high for very well-planned work; sonnet 5.5 extra high for a simple change with some ambiguity |
| reviewer | one fresh agent per PR once CI is green, at most three rounds. big changes run `/interrogate` | opus 5.5 high; `/interrogate` on opus 5.5 extra high plus a gemini 4 argon seat |
| parallel builders | up to three builder and reviewer pairs at once, each on its own PR | same as builder and reviewer |
| investigator | read-only questions. no PR | sonnet 5.5 high |
| watcher | only when waiting on something long, such as a deploy | sonnet 5.5 medium |

PRs stay draft. no agent marks a PR ready, merges it, or tags a release; James does all three. James's standing orders win over anything else in JStack.

to keep `/j-mode` on across turns, pick it from the `/` menu and press option+enter (mac) or alt+enter (windows). that makes it a [custom mode](https://cursor.com/docs/skills).

## skills

`/j-mode` runs most of these for you when a job needs them. the table is for when you want one directly.

<details>
<summary>all skills</summary>

| skill | use it when |
|---|---|
| [`/j-mode`](./skills/j-mode/SKILL.md) | default entry point. picks one job (architect, builder, reviewer, investigator, or parallel builders) and keeps PRs draft. |
| [`/j-help`](./skills/j-help/SKILL.md) | you're new to JStack, or unsure which job, skill, or principle fits. finds out what you're trying to do, answers that part, and hands you a prompt to type. runs only when you type `/j-help`. |
| [`/in-your-own-words`](./skills/in-your-own-words/SKILL.md) | you want the agent to play back your goal and the problem before it starts. runs only when you type `/in-your-own-words`. |
| [`/sharpen`](./skills/sharpen/SKILL.md) | you want a task approached the way a top expert would, aimed at what you're really after, without overspecifying it or deciding your choices for you. |
| [`/how`](./skills/how/SKILL.md) | you want a walkthrough of how a subsystem works. |
| [`/why`](./skills/why/SKILL.md) | you want to know why something was built this way. discovers available MCPs at run time and queries each evidence category in parallel (source control, issue tracker, long-form docs, real-time chat, infra observability, error tracking, analytics warehouse). |
| [`/recall`](./skills/recall/SKILL.md) | you're starting or resuming work and want your recent context on a topic rebuilt from your own chat history and the shared record, handed back as a tight current-state brief. |
| [`/ketchup`](./skills/ketchup/SKILL.md) | you want what changed in this chat since your last message, in a few plain sentences and small visuals, with just enough context on each action item to make the call. |
| [`/blast-radius`](./skills/blast-radius/SKILL.md) | you have a small-looking change and want to know what else it could break, with the one fact it's safe because of proven by running code, not asserted. |
| [`/architect`](./skills/architect/SKILL.md) | you're about to write code that crosses a function boundary and want the caller's usage, types, and module shape settled first. |
| [`/arena`](./skills/arena/SKILL.md) | you want N parallel attempts at the same thing, then to grab the best parts of each. |
| [`/swarm`](./skills/swarm/SKILL.md) | you want N parallel workers across different slices or races, then one aggregated report. |
| [`/interrogate`](./skills/interrogate/SKILL.md) | you have a diff and want different models to try to break it, including a strict code-quality lens. |
| [`/automate-me`](./skills/automate-me/SKILL.md) | you want your own `-mode` skill, drafted from how you've actually worked. |
| [`/make-bot-ui`](./skills/make-bot-ui/SKILL.md) | you want a page or dashboard whose buttons wake a Grok Bot over a webhook, including the sender-key handoff and Tailscale. |
| [`/reflect`](./skills/reflect/SKILL.md) | a long task landed and you want the recipe captured as a skill edit. |
| [`/correct`](./skills/correct/SKILL.md) | you keep correcting agents for the same mistakes. mines history for mistake classes, fixes each at the highest level that works (architecture, then types, lint, and ci, then tests, with docs last), and keeps a table pairing each rule with what enforces it. |
| [`/teach`](./skills/teach/SKILL.md) | you want to actually understand a change or subsystem, not just have it summarized. runs how + why and weaves one plain explanation, built up diagram by diagram. |
| [`/tdd`](./skills/tdd/SKILL.md) | you're fixing a bug and there's a cheap local test path. write the failing test first, then the fix. |
| [`/benchmark-checklist`](./skills/benchmark-checklist/SKILL.md) | you ran a benchmark or measured a speedup or regression. vets the number (limiter, tuning, errors, repeat runs, end-to-end relevance) before you report or act on it. |
| [`/no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md) | strip comments before review; spawns Comment Sicko, fixes accepted findings, offers encodings for claimed constraints. |
| [`/typescript-best-practices`](./skills/typescript-best-practices/SKILL.md) | you're reading or editing typescript. grounds the type-system-discipline principle in syntax. |
| [`/figure-it-out`](./skills/figure-it-out/SKILL.md) | no job fits. designs a rigorous, auditable one-off plan for the task. |
| [`/show-me-your-work`](./skills/show-me-your-work/SKILL.md) | you want a reviewable decision trail. logs decisions to a tsv you can commit. |
| [`/create-verification-skill`](./skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md) | your project has no scripted way to prove app behavior. generates a project-local verify skill with a feature map, for any language or platform. |
| [`/maintain-verification-skill`](./skills/maintain-verification-skill/SKILL.md) | your verify skill's feature map has drifted from the app. source wave + one live pass, at most one PR of proven corrections. |
| [`/unslop`](./skills/unslop/SKILL.md) | you're cleaning up writing. removes AI tells. |
| [`/bro`](./skills/bro/SKILL.md) | you want the last message restated in plain human language, no jargon. |
| [`/technical-writing`](./skills/technical-writing/SKILL.md) | layered doc standard (Diátaxis + Google developer style + STE + Global English) for docs, RFCs, readmes, PR descriptions, commit messages. |

## the `j-agent` and Comment Sicko subagents

every builder, reviewer, architect, and helper is spawned as [`subagent_type: "j-agent"`](./agents/j-agent.md), which reads `j-mode` in full before doing any work. [Comment Sicko](./agents/comment-sicko.md) is a read-only comment reviewer. usually invoke it through [`/no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md).

## principles

twenty-four short skills, one principle each. `j-mode` indexes them inline. the standalone files let other skills reference a principle by name.

<details>
<summary>all twenty-four principles</summary>

| principle | group | rule |
|---|---|---|
| [laziness-protocol](./skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) | core | Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem. |
| [foundational-thinking](./skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) | core | Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious. |
| [redesign-from-first-principles](./skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) | core | Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on. |
| [attack-the-premise](./skills/principle-attack-the-premise/SKILL.md) | core | Apply when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Write the premise down and test it directly before you write another fix that assumes it. |
| [subtract-before-you-add](./skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) | core | Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base. |
| [minimize-reader-load](./skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) | core | Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope. |
| [outcome-oriented-execution](./skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) | core | Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code. |
| [experience-first](./skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) | core | Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones. |
| [exhaust-the-design-space](./skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) | core | Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing. |
| [build-the-lever](./skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) | core | Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun. |
| [model-the-domain](./skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) | architecture | Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals. |
| [boundary-discipline](./skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions. |
| [type-system-discipline](./skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas. |
| [make-operations-idempotent](./skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) | architecture | Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs. |
| [migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis](./skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) | architecture | Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers. |
| [separate-before-serializing-shared-state](./skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) | architecture | Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant. |
| [prove-it-works](./skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'. |
| [fix-root-causes](./skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) | verification | Trace each symptom back to the first place the system went wrong and fix it there. A guard is a fix only when the state it handles is legitimate. |
| [sequence-verifiable-units](./skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer. |
| [test-behavior-not-implementation](./skills/principle-test-behavior-not-implementation/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply when you write, change, or keep a test. Assert what the code's users can observe, so the test fails when that behavior breaks and keeps passing when only the internals change. |
| [explain-the-number](./skills/principle-explain-the-number/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply before you trust, report, or act on a number you measured: a speedup, a regression, a throughput, a latency, or an eval result. Find what limits it, and rule out that it measured something other than the work you think. |
| [guard-the-context-window](./skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) | delegation | Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads. |
| [never-block-on-the-human](./skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) | delegation | Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions. |
| [encode-lessons-in-structure](./skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) | meta | Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text. |

## automations

JStack also ships a dormant [benny automation pack](./automations/benny/). benny triages slack issue reports, then reproduces and fixes confirmed bugs with real ui evidence. its files are not registered as slash skills.

to set it up, point cursor at [`FOR_AGENTS.md`](./automations/benny/FOR_AGENTS.md). setup copies the pack into the target repository at `.cursor/automations/benny/`, enables JStack there for shared skills, and keeps user configuration outside the copied pack.
